  lyrics: `So, you're leaving, aren't you?
  I knew it when you said just then
  When you told me you were leaving
  That's when I definitely knew
  But if you're trying to break my heart
  Your plan is flawed from the start
  You can't break my heart, it's liquid
  It melted when I met you
  And as you turn around to leave
  Don't turn back to me
  Don't turn around and see if I'm crying
  I'm not crying
  
  I'm not crying
  It's just been raining on my face
  And if you think you see some tear tracks down my cheeks
  Please, please, don't tell my mates
  
  I'm not crying
  No, I'm not crying
  And if I am crying
  It's not cause of you
  It's because I'm thinking about a friend of mine who you don't know who is dying
  That's right, dying
  These aren't tears of sadness because you're leaving me
  I've just been cutting onions
  I'm making a lasagna
  For one
  Oh, I'm not crying
  No
  
  There's just a little bit of dust in my eye
  That's from the path that you made when you said your goodbye
  I'm not weeping because you won't be here to hold my hand
  For your information, there's an inflammation in my tear gland
  I'm not upset because you left me this way
  My eyes are just a little sweaty today
  They've been looking around
  They're like searching for you
  They've been looking for you
  Even though I told them not to
  These aren't tears of sadness
  They're tears of joy
  I'm just laughing
  Ha ha ha-ha ha
  
  I'm sitting at this table called love
  Staring down at the irony of life
  How come we've reached this fork in the road
  And yet it cuts like a knife?
  
  I'm not cryyying
  I'm not cryyying
  I'm not cry-y-y-ying`,
